# Data Sources

Most of the data used through the portal comes from the Filecoin chain itself. There is also some off-chain data like [Datacap Applications](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus) or [Storage Provider's Reputation scores](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/reputation-systems-in-filecoin/) that are collected from other places.

## Deals

Deals data is available on chain and can be obtained in different ways:

- Doing a `StateMarketDeals` JSON-RPC call and parsing the returned JSON. If you don't have a node running, you can use [Glif nodes](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/developers/glif-nodes/) `StateMarketDeals` periodic dump on S3 ([direct link](https://marketdeals.s3.amazonaws.com/StateMarketDeals.json.zst)).
- Using an [oracle like `fil-naive-marketwatch`](https://github.com/ribasushi/fil-naive-marketwatch).
- Reconstructing the deals state [from Lily](https://lilium.sh/) tables.

## Clients

Clients can be derived from the [deals](#deals) dataset and expanded with the following sources:

- Datacap. From [Datacap Stats API](https://datacapstats.io/) calling `https://api.datacapstats.io/api/getVerifiedClients`. You get a JSON of verified clients in the FIL+ program that contains client names, Datacap application data and other self-reported data. Alternatively, this data can be obtained by parsing the relevant GitHub repositories issues and comments.

## Storage Providers

Storage Providers be derived from the [deals](#deals) dataset. More information about proviers can be collected in the following sources:

- Location using the different [provider.quest](https://provider.quest/) endpoints/datasets.
